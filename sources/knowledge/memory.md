**Project context**

Max (Cordial) and Marcus Melkersson (senior manager) are creating an executive transformation assessment report for SH Pension documenting their critical IT transformation (Individual → Lumera, 2023-2026).

**Key characteristics:**
- Transparency over promotion - documenting successes AND ongoing challenges
- Strategic investment, NOT cost savings (Lumera costs MORE than Individual)
- Growth enablement: 280 mkr → 1 000 mkr target in annual premiums
- Six målområden with 41 strategic business requirements (SAK)
- Deliverable: December 2025 to leadership and board

**Stakeholders:** Annelie Helsing (VD), Lars Carlsson (CFO), Jonas Hällgren (IT-chef), Maja Carlzon (HR & Affärsutvecklingschef), Åsa Sjölander (Chef Kunderbjudande & Support)

**Project status:** Strong foundation established with completed stakeholder interviews, polished transcriptions, SAK assessment frameworks, and comprehensive report chapters documenting the journey from 2022 crisis through 2025 progress. Current work focuses on validating data accuracy, quantifying impacts, and developing the external perspective chapter.

**Key learnings & principles**

1. **AI-assisted knowledge work:** "AI creates 80% first draft, humans refine 20%" - proper file structure and navigation are essential for effective AI collaboration
2. **Evidence-based reporting:** Consistently validate claims against source data and correct deviations to maintain credibility
3. **Separate internal vs. market effects:** Transformation success requires distinguishing what comes from internal improvements vs. broader market trends
4. **Dual systems create inefficiency:** Full effect only realized after legacy decommissioning
5. **Strategy-driven narrative:** SH Pension chose growth strategy first, then discovered Individual couldn't support it - reframe from "existential crisis" to "strategy first, transformation followed"
6. **Transparency builds trust:** Document both successes and areas where results lag behind projections

**Approach & patterns**

**Analytical framework:**
- Three-stage model: 2022 startläge → 2025 nuläge → 2026 målläge
- Concrete metrics + direct interview quotes
- Iterative: Claude draft → Max refinement → stakeholder review

**Interview & workshop methodology:**
- Systematic frameworks with role-specific questions
- Post-it methodology with color-coded response types
- Push for quantifiable examples over abstract statements
- Focus on costs, incident frequencies, concrete operational impacts

**Knowledge management:**
- Main knowledge base + numbered patches (patches always win)
- Concise, visually organized materials over lengthy explanations
- Practical, immediately implementable deliverables

**Tools & resources**

**Domain expertise:** Swedish business terminology, pension industry concepts, tjänstepension

**Documentation types:**
- Interview transcripts (polished, structured)
- CSV files (SAK assessments, workshop results)
- Strategic business requirements (41 SAK across 6 målområden)
- Decision logs and transformation timelines

**Analytical tools:**
- Effect matrices (initiatives → KPIs)
- Dual risk matrices (before/after risk reduction)
- Displacement analysis (4 dimensions)
- Do-nothing scenario analysis

**Output formats:**
- Markdown (primary)
- Excel (conditional formatting, data validation)
- PowerPoint/LaTeX (when needed)

**Collaboration:** Google Docs, Notion, systematic file organization for LLM context management
